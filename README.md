#README
This is my submission for Project 1 of Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree. The program I have developed reads video clips taken from a camera looking forward through the windshield of a car, tries to detect the lane markings, and write a clip where the lane markings have been highlighted.
##DEPENDENCIES
Python 3.\* needs to be installed, along with Jupyter, Open CV 3.2 for Python and the following Python packages
 - matplotlib
 - numpy
 - sklearn
 - moviepy
 
I have tested the code under Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit with Python 3.5.

##RUNNING THE CODE
Open **runme.ipynb** with Jupyter and execute the code in it (Cell > Run All).
##PROJECT STRUCTURE
- **README.md** this file
- **runme.ipynb** the source code in a Jupiter notebook
- **runme.py** the source code as a text file
- **writeup.md** my report on the program I have written, with a description of its image processing
- **./output_clips** directory where processed video clips will be written (output)
- **./test_clips** directory containing the MP4 clips to be processed (input)
- **./test_images** JPEG images useful to test and debug the program

##CREDITS
The implementation started from a template provided by Udacity and contains some code from the template. Udacity provided test images and test video clips.
